I have made use of the small pallete wildcard, all assets use either white or black or red or cyan.

Apologies for the poor quality, due to coursework and exams I didn't spend as much time on this as I probably should have.
It was still a fun event and I was able to get more Godot practice with this.

Audio warning, it does sound rather bad, and i would recommend you keep it on lower volumes.
